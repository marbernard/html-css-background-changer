# html-css-background-changer
One of my first projects, that uses only html and CSS to give you the ability of changing the color of the background.

# Summary
  This web application loads up with a single button labeled "background changer", when the button is clicked a list of background options appear to be visible. When a color is selected it leads to another page in html with the same contents of previous one, but with your selected color as the background.
