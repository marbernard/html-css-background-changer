# html-css-background-changer
One of my first projects, that uses only html and CSS to give you the ability of changing the color of the background.

Summary
  This web application loads up with a single button labeled "background changer", when the button is clicked a list of background options appear to be visible. 
When a color is selected it leads to another page in html with the same contents of previous one, but with your selected color as the background.
